# openclaw-rs

Single-binary Rust rewrite of OpenClaw. No plugins: every feature is built in.

## Scope

| Area | Status |
|---|---|
| OpenRouter chat (streaming, tool calls) | phase 1 ✅ |
| Sessions + history in SQLite | phase 1 ✅ |
| CLI (`chat`, `ask`, `sessions`) | phase 1 ✅ |
| Tools: shell and files, with approval | phase 2 ✅ |
| Long-term memory search (SQLite FTS5) | phase 3 ✅ |
| Gateway HTTP/WebSocket + Web UI | phase 4 ✅ |
| Scheduled tasks / heartbeat, OpenRC service | phase 5 ✅ |
| QQ channel (official QQ Bot API) | phase 6 ✅ |
| Email channel (IMAP in, SMTP out) | ✅ |

## Build for Raspberry Pi (Alpine, aarch64)

Alpine uses musl, so build a static binary. Cross-compile from any Linux host:

```sh
rustup target add aarch64-unknown-linux-musl
pip install ziglang && cargo install cargo-zigbuild
cargo zigbuild --release --target aarch64-unknown-linux-musl
scp target/aarch64-unknown-linux-musl/release/openclaw-rs pi:/usr/local/bin/
```

Or build on the Pi itself: `apk add cargo build-base && cargo build --release`.

## Usage

```sh
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...
cargo build --release
./target/release/openclaw-rs ask "hello"
./target/release/openclaw-rs chat --session work
./target/release/openclaw-rs sessions
./target/release/openclaw-rs memory add "Prefers answers in Chinese"
./target/release/openclaw-rs memory search chinese
```

## Gateway and Web UI

```sh
export OPENCLAW_RS_TOKEN=$(head -c 24 /dev/urandom | base64)
./target/release/openclaw-rs serve            # http://127.0.0.1:18789/#token=<token>
```

The Web UI streams replies, lists sessions, and shows an approve/deny card
for every `ask` tool. Turns run one at a time per session and keep running if
the browser disconnects; an approval nobody answers within five minutes is
declined. Without a token the Gateway only binds to loopback.

```toml
[gateway]
bind = "127.0.0.1:18789"
# token = "..."   # prefer OPENCLAW_RS_TOKEN
```

## Scheduled jobs

`serve` runs jobs on standard 5-field cron schedules in the host's local time.
A job's prompt runs as a turn in its session; tools set to `ask` are declined
because nobody is there to approve. A job missed while the Gateway was down
runs once at startup, then follows its schedule. A heartbeat is a job:

```sh
openclaw-rs cron add heartbeat "*/30 * * * *" -s main "Check my notes and reminders"
openclaw-rs cron list
openclaw-rs cron remove heartbeat
```

The model can also create, list and remove jobs (`cron_add`, `cron_list`,
`cron_remove`); a job it creates runs in the conversation that asked for it.

## OpenRC service

```sh
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-... OPENCLAW_RS_TOKEN=...
doas openclaw-rs service install --user pi   # or sudo -E
rc-service openclaw-rs status
tail -f /var/log/openclaw-rs.log
doas openclaw-rs service uninstall           # keeps state and logs
```

The service runs as the given account with state in its `~/.openclaw-rs`,
under `supervise-daemon` with automatic restart. The two variables above are
copied into `/etc/conf.d/openclaw-rs` (mode 0600).

## QQ (official bot)

1. Create a bot on the [QQ Open Platform](https://q.qq.com), note the AppID and
   AppSecret, and request the group and private-chat message permission.
2. Under 事件订阅与回调地址 (event subscription and callback URL), choose **WebSocket**. It needs no public address,
   which suits a Pi at home.
3. Configure and restart `serve`:

```toml
[qq]
enabled = true
app_id = "102xxxxxx"
# app_secret = "..."      # prefer QQ_APP_SECRET
allow = []                # user/group openids allowed to talk to the bot
```

Each private chat and each group is its own session (`qq:c2c:<openid>`,
`qq:group:<openid>`). The log prints every sender's openid, so you can fill in
`allow`. QQ users cannot approve tools, so `ask` tools are declined there; if
`tools.shell` or `tools.write` is `allow`, the Gateway refuses to start QQ
until `allow` is set. Replies go out as passive replies (up to 4 messages per
private message, 5 per group message, about 1500 characters each) and fall
back to active messages once QQ's reply window has passed. Scheduled jobs whose
session is a QQ session send their result to that chat.

## Email

The bot polls a mailbox over IMAP and replies over SMTP in the same thread.
Each sender address is its own session (`mail:<address>`).

```toml
[mail]
enabled = true
imap_host = "imap.qq.com"     # 163: imap.163.com, Gmail: imap.gmail.com
imap_port = 993
smtp_host = "smtp.qq.com"
smtp_port = 465               # implicit TLS; use 587 with smtp_security = "starttls"
username = "bot@qq.com"
# password = "..."            # prefer MAIL_PASSWORD; QQ Mail and 163 need an authorization code
allow = ["me@example.com", "@family.cn"]   # required: addresses or @domains
poll_secs = 60
```

- `allow` is required, because anyone could otherwise spend your model
  credits by email. Replies always go to `From`, never `Reply-To`.
- Auto-replies, mailing lists (`Auto-Submitted`, `Precedence`, `List-Id`) and
  mail from the bot's own address are skipped, and replies carry
  `Auto-Submitted: auto-replied`, so two robots cannot loop.
- Each poll marks fetched mail as read and handles at most 20 messages;
  Message-IDs are remembered, so a re-delivered copy is answered once.
- Quoted history (`>` lines, `On … wrote:`, `原始邮件`) is removed before the model
  sees the mail. GBK/GB18030 and other legacy charsets are decoded.
- The client sends the IMAP `ID` command, which 163/126 require.
- `imap_security`/`smtp_security` = `"none"` is accepted only for loopback
  hosts, for local bridges such as Proton Bridge.
- Email has no way to approve tools, so `ask` tools are declined.
- Scheduled jobs whose session is a mail session send their result as an email.

Long-term memory is a SQLite FTS5 index with the trigram tokenizer, so Chinese
text matches by substring without word segmentation. Space-separated terms
match any; terms shorter than three characters fall back to `LIKE`. The model
gets `memory_save`, `memory_search` and `memory_delete` tools.

State lives in `~/.openclaw-rs` (override with `OPENCLAW_RS_HOME`):

- `config.toml`: optional settings
- `state.sqlite`: sessions, messages, memories and scheduled jobs

```toml
[model]
model = "openrouter/auto"            # any OpenRouter model id
base_url = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
request_timeout_secs = 300

[agent]
system_prompt = "You are OpenClaw, a helpful personal assistant."
max_steps = 25       # model calls per turn before giving up
history_limit = 200  # recent messages sent to the model

[tools]
# workspace = "/path"   # default: <state dir>/workspace
shell = "ask"           # allow | ask | deny
write = "ask"           # write_file and edit_file; reads are always allowed
shell_timeout_secs = 120
max_output_bytes = 16384
```

Tools: `read_file`, `list_dir`, `write_file`, `edit_file` (one exact, unique
replacement) and `shell` (`sh -c` in the workspace; the whole process group is
killed on timeout). `ask` prompts on the controlling terminal; with no terminal
the action is declined and the model is told so. Tools set to `deny` are not
offered to the model at all.

## Development

```sh
cargo test
cargo clippy --all-targets
```
